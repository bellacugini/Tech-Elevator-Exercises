            <h2>Best Song Lyrics </h2>

            <p>Songs from The Runaways Album ( 1976 )</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Hello, daddy, hello, mom. I'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb. Hello world I'm your wild girl. I'm
                your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb." - Cherry Bomb</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"You put it to me and now we'll play my game. I'll wrap you up and you'll go insane. It took so
                long and I waited my turn. You pay your debt, I'm gonna make you burn, you know." - Blackmail
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>"I got away clean with my fake ID. No more school or mommy for me. Stealing cars and breaking
                hearts. Pills and thrills and acting smart." - Dead End Justice</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"In the naked city. Spaces ain't that pretty. As I was getting dusted. I happened to get busted.
                Oh yes, I was arrested. Oh God, how I protested." - Dead End Justice</blockquote>

            <p>Songs from The Queens of Noise Album ( 1977 )</p>

            <blockquote>"Each night alone I dream. That I'm a rebel roller queen. I'll be a star that shines. I can make
                the whole world mine." - Hollywood</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Out here in the smokey places.
                Looking into those empty faces.
                Short wave says we made the dial.
                I'm wired for ten million miles." - Midnight Music</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"No one here gets out alive.
                Pushing power in overdrive.
                Cobra kings wet and wild.
                Love the devil that's in your smile." - Neon Angels on the Road to Ruin</blockquote>
            <blockquote> "Radio played, you couldn't stay.
                You'd miss your plane in the morning rain.
                Here I am in the limousine.
                Once again the lonely queen." - Heartbeat</blockquote>
